# The Debate Guide: Writing Guidelines

This document establishes the voice, tone, and style for **The Debate Guide: Win Like the Greeks**. All chapter content should adhere to these guidelines to maintain consistency and authenticity.

---

## Voice & Tone

### Core Principles
- **Confident but not arrogant** — Write with authority earned through knowledge, not proclaimed through bravado
- **Active voice** — Address the reader directly as "you"
- **Blend authority with accessibility** — Expert knowledge delivered in approachable language
- **Reference historical examples naturally** — Weave in Greek philosophers, Roman orators, and modern exemplars as living teachers, not museum exhibits

### The Reader Relationship
- You are a knowledgeable guide, not a lecturer
- Treat readers as intelligent adults capable of handling nuance
- Assume curiosity, not prior expertise
- Build on concepts progressively — plant seeds early, harvest them in later chapters

---

## AI Patterns to AVOID

These phrases and constructions signal artificial writing. Never use them:

### Hollow Connectives
- "In conclusion" / "In summary"
- "Furthermore" / "Moreover" / "Additionally"
- "It's worth noting that..."
- "Let's explore..." / "Let's delve into..."
- "Dive deep into"

### Hedging Language
- Excessive use of "perhaps," "it may be," "it could be argued"
- "One might say..."
- "It is important to note..."

### Structural Tells
- Lists that feel like converted bullet points
- Identical sentence openers in consecutive paragraphs
- Overly symmetrical paragraph lengths
- Conclusions that simply restate the introduction

### Tone Issues
- Breathless enthusiasm ("Incredibly powerful!")
- Unnecessary superlatives ("absolutely essential," "truly remarkable")
- False urgency ("You must understand...")

## Human Patterns to EMBRACE

### Sentence Craft
- **Start sentences with And, But, So** when it creates natural flow
- **Use contractions** appropriately (you're, it's, don't) — they're not informal, they're conversational
- **Vary sentence length dramatically** — Follow a complex 40-word sentence with a fragment. Like this.
- **Fragments for emphasis.** Absolutely.

### Concrete Details
- Include **sensory details** when describing historical scenes
- Reference **specific historical figures by name** — Demosthenes, Cicero, Aristotle, Lincoln
- Use **precise examples** over abstract generalizations
- Name **actual debates**, speeches, and texts when possible

### Rhetorical Techniques
- **Rhetorical questions** (sparingly) — engage the reader's mind
- **Callbacks** to earlier chapters and concepts
- **Anticipate objections** — address what the skeptical reader is thinking
- **Occasional direct address** — "Here's what this means for you"

### Natural Transitions
- Let ideas flow logically rather than announcing transitions
- Use callbacks: "Remember the three appeals from Chapter 3?"
- Bridge through examples: "Cicero faced exactly this problem when..."

---

## Chapter Structure

### Length
- **2,400–3,000 words** per chapter
- Chapters should feel substantial but not exhausting

### Opening Hook (First 150 words)
Choose ONE approach per chapter:
1. **Vivid historical scene** — Drop the reader into a moment
2. **Provocative question** — Challenge an assumption
3. **Bold claim** — State something counterintuitive, then back it up
4. **Brief anecdote** — Personal or historical story that illuminates the theme

### Body Structure
- **2-3 major sections** with clear thematic progression
- **2-3 historical examples** woven throughout (not clustered)
- Natural flow between concepts — avoid rigid "Point 1, Point 2, Point 3" structure

### Vocabulary Boxes
Include 2-4 per chapter, formatted as:
```
VOCABULARY: [Greek Term]
Pronunciation: [phonetic]
Meaning: [definition]
Usage: [how/when to apply this concept]
```

Key terms to cover across the book:
- Rhetoric (rheh-TOR-ik)
- Ethos (EE-thos)
- Pathos (PAY-thos)
- Logos (LOH-gos)
- Kairos (KY-ros)
- Stasis (STAY-sis)
- Enthymeme (EN-thih-meem)
- Topos/Topoi (TOH-pos / TOH-poy)
- Elenchus (eh-LENG-kus)
- Aporia (ah-POR-ee-ah)
- Prolepsis (pro-LEP-sis)

### Featured Quotes
- **3-5 blockquotes per chapter**
- Mix historical and contemporary sources
- Include attribution with context
- Quotes should advance the argument, not decorate it

### Exercises
Each chapter ends with **3 practical exercises**:
1. **Reflection exercise** — Internal/analytical
2. **Practice exercise** — Apply the technique
3. **Challenge exercise** — Advanced application or debate prompt

Format:
```
EXERCISE: [Title]
Type: Reflection | Practice | Challenge
[Instructions in 2-4 sentences]
```

## Cross-References

### Interlinking Philosophy
- Cross-references should feel **natural in prose**, not bolted on
- Link forward to create anticipation, backward to reinforce learning
- Format: "This connects to what the Greeks called *kairos*, explored in [Chapter 4](path)"

### Text Elements
- Use `<em>` for emphasis and Greek terms on first use
- Use `<strong>` sparingly for critical points
- Block quotes use `<blockquote>` with proper citation

### Vocabulary Boxes
```html
<div class="vocabulary-box">
    <span class="vocab-term">Kairos</span>

### Quick Tactic Boxes
Include 1-2 per chapter — immediately actionable advice for modern debaters:
```html
<div class="quick-tactic">
    <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
    <div class="tactic-title">The 30-Second Check</div>
    <p>Before responding to any argument, quickly ask yourself three questions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What's the strongest version of this claim?</li>
        <li>What evidence would change my mind?</li>
        <li>What's the common ground here?</li>
    </ol>
</div>
```

**Quick Tactic Guidelines:**
- Keep tactics concrete and immediately usable
- Focus on actions, not abstract principles
- Include numbered steps or checklists when helpful
- Connect to modern contexts: social media, workplace, classrooms
- Balance Greek wisdom with contemporary application
