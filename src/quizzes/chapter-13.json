      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the key difference between formal and informal fallacies?",
      "options": [
        "Formal fallacies have broken logical structure; informal fallacies have flawed content or reasoning",
        "Formal fallacies are more serious; informal fallacies are minor",
        "Formal fallacies are intentional; informal fallacies are accidental",
        "They are the same thing with different names"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Formal fallacies are structural errors—the argument's form is broken regardless of content. Informal fallacies are content errors—the structure might be fine, but something has gone wrong in how the premises relate to the conclusion.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about the 'all dogs are mammals / my cat is a mammal' example.",
        "Which type has a broken logical form?"

      "question": "Match each fallacy with its description:",
      "pairs": [
        {"left": "Ad hominem", "right": "Attacking the person rather than the argument"},
        {"left": "Straw man", "right": "Misrepresenting an opponent's position to make it easier to attack"},
        {"left": "False dilemma", "right": "Presenting only two options when more exist"},
        {"left": "Slippery slope", "right": "Claiming one step will inevitably lead to extreme consequences"}
      ],
      "explanation": "These are the 'greatest hits' of fallacies that appear frequently in everyday argument. Ad hominem attacks the person, straw man distorts the position, false dilemma limits options artificially, and slippery slope assumes an inevitable chain.",
      "hints": [
        "Which fallacy involves misrepresenting what someone said?",
        "Which one presents a false 'either/or' choice?"

    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "According to the chapter, citing an expert in their field of expertise is always a fallacy.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter distinguishes legitimate from illegitimate appeals to authority. Citing a climate scientist on climate change is reasonable; citing that same scientist on unrelated topics isn't. The fallacy occurs when authority is used to shut down inquiry rather than inform it.",
      "hints": [
        "What makes an appeal to authority legitimate?",
        "When does the chapter say expert citation is appropriate?"

      "options": [
        "Assuming that because an argument contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be wrong",
        "Committing multiple fallacies at once",
        "Naming a fallacy incorrectly",
        "Using fallacies intentionally"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter warns that a weak argument can still have a correct conclusion. 'Smoking is bad because my grandfather smoked and died young' is a hasty generalization, but smoking IS bad—we have mountains of evidence to prove it.",
      "hints": [
        "Can a conclusion be correct even if the argument for it is weak?",
        "Why is fallacy-hunting not enough?"
      ]

    {
      "type": "scenario",
      "question": "Based on the chapter's advice on countering fallacies gracefully, what's the best response?",
      "scenario": "In a discussion about healthcare policy, your colleague says: 'You want universal healthcare? So you think the government should control every aspect of our lives?'",
      "options": [
        "Clarify your actual position: 'That's not quite what I said. I support healthcare coverage, not government control of everything. Does that change your response?'",
        "Shout 'Straw man!' and refuse to continue",
        "Accept the mischaracterization and try to defend it",
        "Attack your colleague's character"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter advises: 'Don't name the fallacy. Instead, use redirects.' For a straw man, calmly restate your actual position and ask if that changes their response. This 'sounds like genuine curiosity while making the fallacy impossible to continue.'",
      "hints": [
        "What does the 'Quick Tactic' say about calling out fallacies?",
        "Why is shouting 'Straw man!' ineffective?"
      ]

    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "According to the chapter, what should be the ultimate goal of knowing about fallacies?",
      "options": [
        "Thinking more clearly and holding beliefs that are actually supported by evidence",
        "Winning every argument through superior technique",
        "Making opponents look foolish",
        "Avoiding all disagreements"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter concludes: 'The goal isn't winning arguments through superior technique. It's thinking more clearly—holding beliefs that are actually supported by evidence.' When you catch yourself reaching for a fallacious argument, it signals your position might be weaker than you thought.",
      "hints": [
        "What does the chapter say about self-scrutiny?",
        "Is the goal to win or to understand?"

        "Making an argument based on fear"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A red herring diverts attention by introducing an irrelevant issue. The term comes from the practice of using smoked herring to throw hunting dogs off a scent. In argument, it distracts from the actual point being debated.",
      "hints": [
        "What does changing the subject accomplish?",
        "How does this relate to the image of throwing dogs off a scent?"

        "When the person's character or qualifications are directly relevant to the argument being made",
        "It's always a fallacy",
        "When you're winning the argument",
        "When the opponent deserves it"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains that character can be relevant: if someone's credibility or expertise matters to the argument, questioning it isn't fallacious. 'This financial advisor has been convicted of fraud' is relevant when evaluating their investment advice.",
      "hints": [
        "When does character matter to an argument?",
        "What makes an ad hominem legitimate vs. fallacious?"

      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "According to the chapter, the appeal to tradition ('We've always done it this way') is always fallacious.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter notes that tradition can carry real information—practices that have survived may have survived for good reasons. The fallacy occurs when tradition is used to shut down discussion rather than as evidence worth considering. 'Long survival can be evidence of value.'",
      "hints": [
        "Can tradition carry useful information?",
        "When does appeal to tradition become fallacious?"

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the chapter recommend instead of calling out fallacies by name?",
      "options": [
        "Use redirects—reframe, ask questions, or restate your position to make the fallacy unsustainable",
        "Always name the fallacy loudly",
        "Ignore all fallacies",
        "Respond with your own fallacy"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter's Quick Tactic advises: 'Don't name the fallacy. Instead, use redirects.' For straw man: restate your actual position. For ad hominem: 'That's interesting, but let's focus on the argument.' For false dilemma: 'Are those really the only two options?'",
