      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the key difference between 'chronos' and 'kairos'?",
      "options": [
        "Chronos is clock time; kairos is the opportune moment for action",
        "Chronos is Greek; kairos is Roman",
        "Chronos is for speaking; kairos is for listening",
        "They are the same concept with different spellings"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The Greeks distinguished between chronos (sequential, measurable time) and kairos (the right or opportune moment). A skilled rhetorician knows not just what to say, but when to say it.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about the difference between 'what time is it?' and 'is this the right time?'",
        "One can be measured by a clock; the other requires judgment."
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Kairos can only be recognized in retrospect, never in the moment.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "While kairos can be subtle, the chapter teaches that it can be cultivated through practice. 'Reading the room,' anticipating audience receptivity, and sensing when conditions align are all learnable skills.",
      "hints": [
        "Would the Greeks have taught kairos if it couldn't be learned?",
        "Think about what 'reading the room' means."
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "According to the chapter, what does 'reading the room' involve?",
      "options": [
        "Sensing the audience's mood, energy, and receptivity to your message",
        "Counting how many people are present",
        "Finding the best seat in a meeting",
        "Preparing your notes before speaking"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Reading the room is the practical application of kairos—perceiving the emotional temperature, identifying what the audience needs to hear, and adapting your approach accordingly.",
      "hints": [
        "This skill relates to knowing when, not just what.",
        "Think about what a skilled speaker notices before speaking."
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "scenario",
      "question": "Based on the chapter's teaching about kairos, what should you do?",
      "scenario": "You've prepared a pitch for a new project, but when you arrive at the meeting, you learn that your company just announced layoffs. Your colleagues are distracted and anxious.",
      "options": [
        "Recognize this is not the right moment; reschedule or adapt your pitch significantly",
        "Proceed as planned since you've already prepared",
        "Use the negative mood to create urgency for your project",
        "Ignore the emotional context and focus only on your data"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Kairos requires recognizing when conditions are unfavorable. An audience preoccupied with job security won't be receptive to new initiatives. Pressing forward ignores the kairotic moment—or rather, its absence.",
      "hints": [
        "Is the audience in a state to receive your message?",
        "What would 'reading the room' tell you here?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is 'cultural kairos' as described in the chapter?",
      "options": [
        "The broader social and historical moment that shapes what arguments can succeed",
        "Speaking only in your native language",
        "Using cultural references in speeches",
        "Timing speeches to cultural holidays"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Cultural kairos refers to the larger zeitgeist—the social, political, and historical context that makes certain arguments timely or untimely. MLK's 'I Have a Dream' succeeded partly because the cultural moment was ready for it.",
      "hints": [
        "Think beyond the immediate audience to the broader moment in history.",
        "Why do some messages resonate in one era but not another?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A perfectly logical argument (strong logos) can fail if delivered at the wrong moment.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "The chapter emphasizes that even the best-constructed argument will fall flat if the timing is wrong. Kairos reminds us that persuasion is contextual—the same words can succeed or fail depending on when and where they're spoken.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about the relationship between timing and receptivity.",
        "Can you think of examples where good ideas failed due to bad timing?"
      ]
