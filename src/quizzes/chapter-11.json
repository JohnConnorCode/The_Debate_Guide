      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Stasis theory identifies where disagreements actually lie. There are four possible stasis points: fact (did it happen?), definition (what should we call it?), quality (was it justified?), and procedure (are we handling it correctly?).",
      "hints": [
        "The chapter says many debates fail because participants 'argue past each other.'",
        "Think about the Greek meaning—it refers to a 'standing point.'"

      "explanation": "Each stasis requires a different type of case. Building a great case about the wrong stasis is worse than useless—it makes you look like you're evading the real question.",

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The warrant answers: 'Why does this evidence support this claim?' Warrants are often unstated (like enthymeme premises), but identifying them is crucial for understanding and attacking arguments.",

      "question": "According to the chapter, you should always lead with your strongest argument first.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter describes three approaches: strongest first (captures attention), strongest last (builds to climax), and strong-weak-strong (Nestorian order, burying weaker arguments in the middle). The best approach depends on context.",

        "Each argument should be exactly one sentence long",
        "Opponents should be defeated with just one sentence",
        "Introductions should be limited to one sentence"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The one-sentence test forces precision. 'If you can't do this, your case isn't clear enough yet.' This core sentence becomes your thesis—the organizing principle for everything else.",

      "scenario": "You're preparing to argue against a new company policy requiring return-to-office. Before building your case, you realize people disagree about different aspects: some dispute that remote work hurts productivity (fact), some argue about what counts as 'collaboration' (definition), some debate whether any productivity gain justifies the employee burden (quality).",
      "options": [
        "Identify which stasis is the real point of disagreement before building your case",

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter emphasizes that 'building a great case about the wrong stasis is worse than useless.' You must first identify where the real disagreement lies—then build a case that addresses that specific stasis.",
      "hints": [
        "What happens when participants argue about different questions?",
        "Why does stasis matter before case construction?"
