      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Stasis theory, developed by Hermagoras, identifies where disagreements actually lie. There are four possible stasis points: fact (did it happen?), definition (what should we call it?), quality (was it justified?), and procedure (are we handling it correctly?).",
      "hints": [
        "The chapter says many debates fail because participants 'argue past each other.'",
