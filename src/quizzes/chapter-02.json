      "options": [
        "Democracy created a system where words, not violence, decided outcomes—citizens needed to speak persuasively",
        "Philosophers were bored and needed new subjects to study",
        "They wanted to train professional lawyers",
        "Greek religion required elaborate ritual speeches"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'When the Greeks invented democracy, they also invented a problem: how do you make decisions when thousands of citizens get an equal vote? Swords wouldn't work. Bribery was illegal. The only weapon left was words.'",
      "hints": [
        "Consider what changed when citizens gained equal voting rights.",

      "pairs": [
        {"left": "Protagoras", "right": "'Man is the measure of all things'—truth is relative to perception"},
        {"left": "Gorgias", "right": "Master stylist who saw persuasion as the greatest form of power"},
        {"left": "Plato", "right": "Attacked rhetoric as flattery; wanted philosophy seeking truth instead"},
        {"left": "Aristotle", "right": "Systematized rhetoric in a neutral framework; identified ethos, pathos, logos"}
      ],
      "explanation": "Protagoras taught relativism and arguing both sides. Gorgias dazzled with stylistic performance. Plato condemned Sophistic rhetoric in dialogues like the Gorgias. Aristotle synthesized both concerns, creating systematic rhetorical theory that acknowledged both utility and ethics.",

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the chapter say about the Sophists' reputation as 'dishonest intellectuals'?",
      "options": [
        "The reputation comes largely from Plato, but the historical picture is more complicated and fairer to them",
        "They were genuinely fraudulent and deserved their bad reputation",
        "They had an excellent reputation in ancient times",
        "Modern scholars have completely rehabilitated them"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter states: 'This reputation comes largely from Plato, who made the Sophists his philosophical villains. But the historical picture is more complicated, and fairer to the Sophists themselves.' They were practical educators who 'delivered results' and raised important philosophical questions about relativism.",
      "hints": [
        "Who wrote dialogues attacking the Sophists?",

      "question": "According to Aristotle's definition, rhetoric IS persuasion itself.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter quotes Aristotle: 'Rhetoric is the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion.' It emphasizes the distinction: 'Rhetoric isn't persuasion; it's observing the means of persuasion.' This framing allows neutral study—like a doctor understanding disease without wishing to spread it.",
      "hints": [
        "Read Aristotle's definition carefully—what verb does he use?",
        "How does the chapter explain this distinction?"

      "question": "What is an 'enthymeme' according to the chapter?",
      "options": [
        "Rhetoric's version of a syllogism, with one premise left unstated for the audience to supply",
        "A type of emotional appeal",
        "A formal logical proof with all steps shown",
        "A Greek debate format"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'Aristotle gave us the concept of the enthymeme, rhetoric's version of the logical syllogism... arguments that leave some premises unstated, relying on the audience to fill in the gaps.' Example: 'He's a politician, so he's probably dishonest'—the unstated premise is 'Politicians are usually dishonest.'",

        "What's different about rhetorical logic vs. formal logic?",
        "What role does the audience play in completing the argument?"

      "scenario": "You're evaluating a YouTube economics commentator who posts daily hot takes. You notice they've never publicly changed their position despite being wrong about several predictions.",

        "'Look for Plato's concern'—checking if they flatten complexity"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The Quick Tactic includes: 'Watch over time. Do they update their views when presented with good evidence? Intellectual honesty shows in the corrections.' Never changing position despite being wrong is a red flag for intellectual honesty.",

        "AI language models",
        "Social media algorithms",
        "Ancient Greek texts translated online"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter draws parallels: 'Protagoras would recognize them instantly. He traveled from city to city, built audiences through reputation, charged for access to wisdom... The modern version does the same, except the travel happens through fiber optic cables.' Examples include Joe Rogan, TED speakers, and creators like ContraPoints.",
      "hints": [

      "question": "According to the chapter, Plato's dialogues were themselves masterpieces of rhetoric even while attacking rhetoric.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "The chapter identifies this irony: 'Plato's position had problems. For one thing, his dialogues themselves were masterpieces of rhetoric. The way he framed the arguments, the personalities he gave his characters, the literary techniques he employed to guide readers toward his conclusions. All of this was persuasion. Plato was attacking rhetoric with rhetoric's own weapons.'",
      "hints": [
        "How did Plato communicate his ideas?",
        "Did he use persuasive techniques in his own writing?"

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the chapter say happened to rhetorical education over the past century?",
      "options": [
        "It has largely vanished—we teach students to write essays but not to argue in public",
        "It has dramatically expanded in schools",
        "It shifted from Greek to Roman models",
        "It became mandatory in all democracies"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter states: 'Over the past century, rhetoric has largely vanished from education. We teach students to write essays, but we don't teach them to argue in public. We expect them to participate in democracy, but we don't give them the tools the Greeks developed for exactly that purpose.'",
      "hints": [
        "What does the chapter say students are and aren't taught?",
        "How does this connect to Chapter 1's concerns about discourse?"

      "options": [
        "More than a city-state—a community of citizens bound by participation in shared governance",
        "A type of debate format",
        "A Greek temple",
        "A philosophical school"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The vocabulary box explains: 'The Greek city-state, but the word meant more than geography. The polis was a community of citizens bound by participation in shared governance. To be part of a polis was to have a voice, and using that voice well was the essence of citizenship.'",
      "hints": [
        "How does the chapter define citizenship in the polis?",
        "What made the polis different from just a city?"
