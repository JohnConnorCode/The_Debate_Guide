    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does Socrates's behavior at his trial teach about the 'philosopher's victory'?",
      "options": [
        "That some victories of principle matter more than outcomes—he chose integrity over survival",
        "That you should always fight to win at any cost",
        "That legal trials are always unfair",
        "That philosophy is impractical"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Socrates could have begged for mercy or moderated his positions. Instead, he reaffirmed everything his accusers held against him. He lost the trial but won something larger—demonstrating that some commitments are worth more than winning.",
      "hints": [
        "Did Socrates prioritize winning his case or something else?",
        "What did Socrates preserve by not compromising?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "According to the chapter, the ultimate goal of learning debate is to win every argument you enter.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter concludes that the true purpose of debate mastery is wisdom and flourishing (eudaimonia), not victory. The philosopher's victory comes from thinking more clearly, understanding more deeply, and holding beliefs that are genuinely well-supported—even when that means changing your mind.",
      "hints": [
        "What does the chapter say about the relationship between debate and wisdom?",
        "Is changing your mind a defeat or can it be a victory?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is 'eudaimonia' as it relates to debate?",
      "options": [
        "Human flourishing—the good life achieved through wisdom and virtue, not just winning",
        "A winning debate strategy",
        "A type of logical fallacy",
        "A Greek debate tournament"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Eudaimonia is the Greek concept of flourishing or 'the good life.' The chapter argues that debate skills ultimately serve eudaimonia—not by helping you win arguments, but by helping you think clearly, examine your beliefs, and live according to reason.",
      "hints": [
        "What did the Greeks consider the ultimate goal of a good life?",
        "How does wisdom relate to flourishing?"
      ]

      "type": "matching",
      "question": "Match each concept with its meaning for the 'philosopher's victory':",
      "pairs": [
        {"left": "The examined life", "right": "A life spent questioning assumptions and pursuing truth"},
        {"left": "Changing your mind", "right": "A sign of intellectual growth, not defeat"},
        {"left": "Aporia", "right": "Productive confusion—recognizing you don't know what you thought you knew"}
      ],
      "explanation": "The philosopher's victory reconceives success. The examined life pursues truth. Changing your mind through good argument is growth. And aporia—the discomfort of having beliefs challenged—is the sensation of intellectual growth.",
      "hints": [
        "What did Socrates say about the unexamined life?",
        "Is confusion always bad?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "According to the Quick Tactic 'Four-Dimensional Scorecard,' how should you weight 'Outcome' compared to other measures?",
      "options": [
        "Outcome matters least—weight it 1 while Understanding, Relationship, and Character each get 3",
        "Outcome is most important—it should get the highest weight",
        "All four dimensions should be weighted equally",
        "Outcome is the only dimension that matters"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The Four-Dimensional Scorecard suggests weighting roughly 1-3-3-3 for Outcome, Understanding, Relationship, and Character. A loss where you learned, preserved the relationship, and argued with integrity beats a win that cost you all three.",
      "hints": [
        "What matters besides who 'won' the argument?",
        "Can you lose an argument but still succeed overall?"
      ]

    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What example does the chapter use to show how dissents can become future victories?",
      "options": [
        "Ruth Bader Ginsburg's dissent in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, which Congress later enacted as the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act",
        "A Supreme Court majority opinion",
        "A corporate boardroom debate",
        "An ancient Greek philosophical dialogue"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Ginsburg's dissenting opinion laid out why the majority's interpretation failed working women. She lost the case. Congress agreed with her reasoning and passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act two years later. The dissent—the formal admission of losing—became the foundation for legislative victory.",
      "hints": [
        "What happened after Ginsburg lost the case?",
        "How can losing arguments become winning ones over time?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "scenario",
      "question": "Based on the chapter's teaching about the philosopher's victory, what perspective should you take?",
      "scenario": "You've had a long debate with a friend. By the end, you realize they were right and you were wrong. You've changed your position based on their arguments.",
      "options": [
        "Consider this a victory—you've come closer to truth through honest engagement",
        "Feel defeated because you 'lost' the argument",
        "Pretend you agreed with them all along",
        "Resolve to never admit being wrong again"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The philosopher's victory means recognizing that changing your mind through good argument is winning, not losing. You've gained truth. Your previous error has been corrected. This is exactly what debate at its best should accomplish.",
      "hints": [
        "Is holding onto a wrong belief 'winning'?",
        "What's the purpose of debate according to this chapter?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What warning does the chapter give about feeling like a 'misunderstood genius'?",
      "options": [
        "The feeling is identical whether you're actually right or just wrong—you need to look for warning signs of being the crank",
        "If you feel misunderstood, you're definitely right",
        "Only experts can feel misunderstood",
        "Feeling misunderstood means you should argue more loudly"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter warns that for every Semmelweis who was right but rejected, there are dozens of cranks who were wrong and rejected. Both groups feel the same way. The chapter suggests checking: Do field experts reject your view? Have you engaged with counterarguments? Has your position updated at all?",
      "hints": [
        "How can you tell if you're a prophet or a crank?",
        "What questions should you ask yourself?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "According to the chapter, the philosopher's victory means avoiding all strong opinions to stay flexible.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter advocates 'strong opinions, weakly held' (quoting Paul Saffo). The philosopher's victory doesn't mean being passive—Socrates argued strenuously. It means fighting for truth rather than ego, defending positions fiercely while remaining willing to abandon them when evidence demands.",
      "hints": [
        "Did Socrates avoid strong opinions?",
        "What does 'strong opinions, weakly held' mean?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the chapter say about why the jury that condemned Socrates is forgotten?",
      "options": [
        "Because Socrates endured by embodying a way of arguing—seeking truth relentlessly—while those who defeated him didn't stand for anything lasting",
        "Because the trial records were lost",
        "Because Socrates was more famous at the time",
        "Because the jury members had short lifespans"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Socrates's accusers are remembered only for their infamy, while Socrates endures. The chapter explains: 'He showed what it looks like to seek truth relentlessly, to question everything including yourself, to hold beliefs accountable to reason. He showed that you can lose the debate and win the larger struggle for meaning.'",
      "hints": [
        "What made Socrates memorable?",
        "What larger struggle did Socrates win?"
