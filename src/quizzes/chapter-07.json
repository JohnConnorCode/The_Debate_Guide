      "question": "How did Aristotle view emotional appeal in rhetoric?",
      "options": [
        "As a legitimate tool of persuasion on equal footing with character and logic, because emotions carry information",
        "As a necessary evil to be used sparingly",
        "As a contaminant that should be eliminated from serious argument",
        "As something only for manipulating unintelligent audiences"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'Aristotle analyzed emotion as one of three coordinate means of persuasion, on equal footing with character and logic.' His reasoning: 'emotions carry information. Fear tells you something is dangerous. Anger signals injustice. Pity recognizes undeserved suffering.'",
      "hints": [
        "How did Aristotle's view differ from Plato's concerns about rhetoric?",
        "What did Aristotle devote an entire book of his Rhetoric to?"

    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the difference between 'evoking' and 'exploiting' emotion according to the chapter?",
      "options": [
        "Evoking makes people feel what the situation genuinely warrants; exploiting makes them feel things that distort their judgment",
        "Evoking is weaker than exploiting",
        "Exploiting is always more effective",
        "There is no meaningful difference"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter states: 'Evoking emotion means making people feel what the situation genuinely warrants. Exploiting emotion means making people feel things that distort their judgment—fear of dangers that aren't real, pity for those who don't deserve it, hatred directed at innocent targets.'",
      "hints": [
        "What determines whether emotional appeal is ethical?",
        "Does the emotion depend on ignorance or truth?"

    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "According to the chapter's test for ethical emotional appeal, if an emotion would survive full knowledge of the facts, it's legitimate.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "The chapter provides this test: 'If the emotion depends on ignorance, distortion, or misdirection, it's exploitation. If the emotion would survive full knowledge of the facts, it's legitimate evocation.'",
      "hints": [
        "What distinguishes evoking from exploiting?",
        "What role does information play in ethical pathos?"

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does the chapter identify as the 'delivery system' for pathos?",
      "options": [
        "Narrative—story and concrete detail, not abstract statements",
        "Statistics and data charts",
        "Formal logical proofs",
        "Credentials and authority"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'Emotion rarely arrives through abstract statement... Narrative is the delivery system that carries pathos from speaker to audience.' The example of Maria's story moves people in ways that 'Thousands of people die each year' cannot.",
      "hints": [
        "How do effective speakers deliver emotional content?",
        "Why do specific stories move us more than statistics?"

    {
      "type": "scenario",
      "question": "Based on the chapter's analysis of Mark Antony's speech, when is his emotional appeal ethical?",
      "scenario": "In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Mark Antony makes the crowd feel grief and rage about Caesar's death without directly blaming the conspirators.",
      "options": [
        "It depends on whether Caesar deserved grief and the conspirators deserved anger—ethics depends on relationship to truth",
        "It's always manipulation because it uses emotion",
        "It's always ethical because the crowd freely chose to feel",
        "It's always unethical because Antony promised not to blame the conspirators"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'Is Antony manipulating? It depends on whether Caesar deserved grief and the conspirators deserved anger. If Caesar was a tyrant... the appeal is exploitation. If Caesar was a benefactor... the appeal is evocation. The ethics of pathos depend entirely on its relationship to truth.'",
      "hints": [
        "What determines whether emotional appeal is ethical?",
        "Does truth or falsity of the underlying situation matter?"

      "options": [
        "Fast, automatic, emotional—a pattern-recognition engine that often reaches correct conclusions quickly",
        "Slow, deliberate, logical",
        "A primitive holdover from evolution that should be ignored",
        "The part of the brain that processes only language"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'System 1 is fast, automatic, emotional—it generates impressions and feelings without conscious effort... The key insight: System 1 isn't some primitive holdover from our evolutionary past. It's a sophisticated pattern-recognition engine.'",

      "options": [
        "'The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity'—making a claim about injustice through imagery",
        "A list of statistics about economic inequality",
        "A formal logical syllogism",
        "An attack on his opponents' character"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'When he spoke of \"the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity,\" he was making a claim about injustice. The shame and indignation the image provoked weren't distractions from the argument—they were the audience's recognition that yes, this is unjust.'",

        "How did King make arguments in emotional form?",
        "What does the imagery about 'lonely island' communicate?"

        {"left": "Identification", "right": "Helps audience see themselves in the situation"},
        {"left": "Contrast", "right": "Heightens emotion by juxtaposition of opposites"}
      ],
      "explanation": "The chapter identifies these as key techniques: specificity makes things concrete ('a six-year-old girl with braids'), identification creates personal connection ('imagine this happened to your daughter'), and contrast heightens emotion (King's 'promissory note' vs. 'bad check').",
      "hints": [
        "Why does 'a child' move us less than 'a six-year-old girl with braids'?",

      "question": "According to research by Antonio Damasio mentioned in the chapter, patients with damage to emotional brain regions made better decisions because they weren't distracted by feelings.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter describes the opposite: 'These patients could reason logically—they performed normally on IQ tests—but they made disastrous life decisions. Without emotional signals to guide them, they couldn't prioritize among options or sense when something was wrong.'",

        "What happened to patients who lost emotional processing?",

        "Emotion should always override reason",
        "Reason should always override emotion",
        "They operate completely independently"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter states: 'Modern cognitive science has confirmed what Aristotle intuited: emotion isn't the enemy of reason but its partner.' The chapter argues for integration: 'Pathos works best when it's woven together with ethos and logos.'",
