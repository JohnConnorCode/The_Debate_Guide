      "question": "According to the chapter, what is the most counterintuitive technique for building ethos?",
      "options": [
        "Concession — admitting when your opponent has a valid point",
        "Asserting your credentials at the start of every argument",
        "Never acknowledging uncertainty about anything",
        "Attacking your opponent's character directly"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter emphasizes that concession—admitting that your opponent has a point—builds trust because it demonstrates that you care more about truth than victory. This costs something, and audiences recognize that cost.",
      "hints": [
        "What rhetorical move requires you to 'give ground'?",
        "The chapter says this technique 'works precisely because it costs something.'"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "The chapter argues that character in argument is built in a single powerful exchange.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter explicitly states that 'Character in argument isn't built in a single exchange. It's the accumulation of choices over time.' Character compounds through repeated demonstrations of fairness and intellectual honesty.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about the chapter's discussion of the 'long game.'",

      "options": [
        "Interpreting your opponent's words in the most favorable light",
        "Donating to your opponent's cause before debating them",
        "Always letting your opponent speak first",
        "Never disagreeing with anyone publicly"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The principle of charity means interpreting ambiguous statements in the most favorable way and focusing on the strongest version of opposing arguments rather than the weakest. It's about being effective, not just being nice.",
      "hints": [
        "How should you treat an opponent's ambiguous claims?",
        "This principle relates to steelmanning, discussed in Chapter 15."

    {
      "type": "scenario",
      "question": "Based on the chapter's teaching about character, what would be the most effective response?",
      "scenario": "In a team meeting, a colleague challenges your proposal with a criticism that's actually valid. You realize they've identified a real weakness in your plan.",
      "options": [
        "Acknowledge the valid point openly, then explain how you plan to address it",
        "Deflect by changing the subject to something else",
        "Defend your original position without acknowledging the criticism",
        "Attack your colleague's qualifications to make the criticism"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter emphasizes that conceding valid points builds credibility. 'When someone concedes a point you consider valid, something shifts. They've shown they're listening. They've shown they can see what you see.'",
      "hints": [
        "What does the chapter say about how concession affects the dynamic of a discussion?",
        "Think about how intellectual honesty is demonstrated, not just claimed."
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Why does the chapter say 'Your opponent is your greatest ally'?",
      "options": [
        "Because how you treat your opponent reveals your character to the audience",
        "Because opponents always have better arguments than you",
        "Because debates should end in complete agreement",
        "Because opponents can help you avoid making arguments"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter opens with this paradox and explains: 'An audience watches how you handle opposition, and they draw conclusions. Dismiss your opponent unfairly, and you look arrogant. Misrepresent their views, and you look dishonest.'",
      "hints": [
        "What does the audience learn by watching how you treat opponents?",
        "The chapter emphasizes showing character rather than claiming it."

      "explanation": "The chapter argues that calibrating confidence to evidence, conceding valid points, and treating opponents fairly all contribute to building long-term credibility. Misrepresenting opponents does the opposite.",
