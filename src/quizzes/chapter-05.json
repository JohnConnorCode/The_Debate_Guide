      "question": "According to Aristotle, what are the three components of ethos?",
      "options": [
        "Phronesis (practical wisdom), Arete (virtue), Eunoia (goodwill)",
        "Logic, emotion, and timing",
        "Introduction, argument, and conclusion",
        "Speaking, listening, and responding"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Aristotle identified three pillars of credibility: phronesis (demonstrating practical wisdom and competence), arete (displaying moral virtue and character), and eunoia (showing goodwill toward the audience).",
      "hints": [
        "These are Greek terms specific to ethos.",
        "Think about what makes someone trustworthy."

      "explanation": "Phronesis establishes expertise and competence. Arete establishes moral standing. Eunoia establishes that the speaker genuinely cares about the audience, not just their own agenda.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about the questions an audience asks about a speaker.",
        "Which quality relates to caring about the listener?"

      "question": "Ethos is established once at the beginning of a speech and cannot be gained or lost afterward.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter emphasizes that ethos is dynamic—it can be built, damaged, or repaired throughout a speech or over time. Every word and action either adds to or subtracts from your credibility.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about speakers who lost credibility during a speech.",

      "question": "How did Demosthenes build his ethos according to the chapter?",
      "options": [
        "Through years of dedicated practice to overcome his natural limitations",
        "By being born into an influential family",
        "By avoiding public speaking until he was naturally skilled",
        "Through formal education at an elite academy"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Demosthenes famously overcame a speech impediment through rigorous self-training—speaking with pebbles in his mouth, practicing against the sound of waves. His ethos came from demonstrated perseverance, not natural gifts.",
      "hints": [
        "The chapter presents Demosthenes as an example of earned credibility.",
        "What did he have to overcome?"

      "question": "Which component of ethos is this speaker primarily trying to establish?",
      "scenario": "A financial advisor begins a client meeting by saying: 'I'm not going to recommend anything I wouldn't put in my own portfolio. My goal is your long-term financial health, even if that means I earn less in commissions today.'",
      "options": [
        "Eunoia — demonstrating goodwill toward the audience",
        "Phronesis — demonstrating expertise",
        "Arete — demonstrating moral virtue",
        "None of the above"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "By emphasizing that they prioritize the client's interests over their own profit, the advisor is establishing eunoia—genuine care for the audience. This addresses the audience's natural question: 'Are you looking out for me or yourself?'",
      "hints": [
        "What concern is the advisor addressing?",
        "Which component relates to the audience's well-being?"

      "question": "How did Frederick Douglass establish ethos according to the chapter?",
      "options": [
        "Through the power of his self-education and moral authority as one who experienced slavery",
        "By citing his formal university credentials",
        "By avoiding emotional appeals and using only logic",
        "By speaking only to audiences who already agreed with him"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Douglass's credibility came from his lived experience and his remarkable self-education despite being denied formal schooling. His moral authority as someone who had experienced slavery firsthand was unassailable.",
      "hints": [
        "Consider what made Douglass uniquely qualified to speak on slavery.",
        "His ethos combined arete with personal witness."
