      "question": "What is Aristotle's distinction between 'artistic' and 'inartistic' proofs?",
      "options": [
        "Artistic proofs are created by the speaker through rhetoric; inartistic proofs exist independently (documents, statistics, witnesses)",
        "Artistic proofs use creativity; inartistic proofs are boring",
        "Artistic proofs are for artists; inartistic proofs are for scientists",
        "Artistic proofs are ethical; inartistic proofs are manipulative"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'Artistic proofs are constructed through rhetoric: the arguments you build, the emotions you evoke, the credibility you establish. Inartistic proofs exist independently: documents, statistics, witness testimony.'",
      "hints": [
        "What's the difference between evidence you find and evidence you create?",
        "Which type of proof did Aristotle say involves ethos, pathos, and logos?"

      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "According to the chapter, presenting facts to someone who disagrees always changes their mind.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter opens: 'Present someone with facts that contradict their existing views, and they often dig in harder. The evidence doesn't persuade; it provokes. People experience factual challenges to their beliefs as personal attacks.'",
      "hints": [
        "What is the 'backfire effect'?",
        "Why do facts sometimes 'provoke' rather than persuade?"

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is a 'tekmerion' in Aristotle's framework?",
      "options": [
        "An infallible sign—evidence so strong it amounts to proof",
        "A weak piece of evidence",
        "A type of logical fallacy",
        "An emotional appeal"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains that tekmerion is 'an infallible sign—evidence so strong it amounts to proof.' The example: if a woman has given birth, that's tekmerion she's had intercourse. Most evidence is weaker (semeion, fallible signs).",
      "hints": [

      "question": "Match each evidence type with its primary characteristic:",
      "pairs": [
        {"left": "Statistics", "right": "Summarize many cases and seem authoritative, but can be manipulated"},
        {"left": "Testimony", "right": "Depends on witness credibility and directness"},
        {"left": "Examples", "right": "Memorable and emotionally engaging, but can be dismissed as atypical"}
      ],
      "explanation": "Each evidence type has distinct properties. Statistics feel authoritative but can be cherry-picked. Testimony relies on credibility. Examples are vivid but critics can dismiss them. The best arguments combine multiple types.",

      "type": "scenario",
      "question": "Based on the chapter's teaching about choosing evidence, what would be most effective?",
      "scenario": "You're presenting a proposal to two different groups: data-driven executives and frontline employees who distrust corporate statistics.",
      "options": [
        "Use data and methodology for executives; use stories and personal testimony for employees",
        "Use the same evidence for both groups to be consistent",
        "Use only emotional appeals for both groups",
        "Avoid evidence entirely and rely on your authority"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter emphasizes: 'Different audiences respond to different types of evidence.' Experts want data and methodology; laypeople want stories. 'Understanding what counts as evidence for your audience is as important as knowing the hierarchy itself.'",
      "hints": [
        "Why might frontline employees distrust corporate statistics?",
        "What does the chapter say about matching evidence to audience?"

    {
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "According to the chapter, when does evidence fail to persuade?",
      "options": [
        "When it threatens identity, when trust in sources is gone, in zero-sum conflicts, or when values diverge",
        "Only when the evidence is factually wrong",
        "Evidence always works if presented clearly enough",
        "Only when the audience is unintelligent"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter identifies four conditions where evidence fails: identity threat ('beliefs central to sense of who they are'), trust deficit ('institutions that produce evidence are corrupt'), zero-sum conflicts, and divergent values.",

        "Social media only shares high-quality evidence"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter notes: 'Social media inverts these hierarchies. A viral personal story—lowest tier in scientific terms—routinely outperforms peer-reviewed meta-analyses in persuasive power... narrative stickiness and emotional resonance operate on different channels than epistemic rigor.'",

      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "According to the chapter, inartistic proofs (like documents and statistics) are completely objective.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter states: 'This appearance of objectivity gives inartistic proofs rhetorical power—they feel independent of the speaker's bias. But that objectivity is partly illusion. Someone chose which statistics to cite, which documents to present, which witnesses to call. The selection itself is rhetorical.'",
      "hints": [
        "Who decides which evidence to present?",
        "Is selection itself a rhetorical act?"

        "Accepting confirming evidence with minimal scrutiny while subjecting disconfirming evidence to intense criticism",

        "Using evidence to motivate others",
        "A technique for building better arguments"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'We accept evidence that confirms our beliefs with minimal scrutiny. We subject disconfirming evidence to intense criticism, looking for any flaw that would let us dismiss it. The same evidence encounters different standards depending on whether it supports or challenges what we already think.'",
      "hints": [

      "options": [
        "Combine inartistic proofs (raw evidence) with artistic proofs (structure and interpretation) to create persuasive arguments",
        "Use only statistics for maximum credibility",
        "Avoid evidence and rely solely on emotional appeals",
        "Present evidence without any interpretation"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter states: 'The best arguments combine both types. Inartistic proofs provide the raw material; artistic proofs shape that material into persuasive form. A lawyer doesn't just dump documents on a jury. She explains what they mean, why they matter, how they connect.'",
      "hints": [
        "What does a lawyer do beyond presenting documents?",
        "What roles do evidence and argument each play?"
