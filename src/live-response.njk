            Your opponent just made a point you weren't expecting. The clock is ticking. Everyone's watching. What do you say?
        </p>

        <p>
            This guide gives you decision trees for exactly these moments. Not theory—tactics. Follow the SITUATION → DIAGNOSIS → RESPONSE pattern, pick your approach, and execute. These responses have been battle-tested in competitive debate, boardrooms, and difficult conversations.

        <h2>SUPERDEBATE PHASE-SPECIFIC TACTICS</h2>

        <p>
            In SuperDebate's 28-minute format, each phase demands different skills. Here's what to do—and what to avoid—in each.
        </p>

        <h3>During Constructive (5 minutes)</h3>

        <p>
            Your job: build a case the judges remember. You have exactly 300 seconds.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Opening Hook (First 15 Seconds)</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The 3-Second Rule</div>
            <p>Judges decide if you're worth listening to in three seconds. Start strong:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bold claim:</strong> "This debate will determine whether [stakes]."</li>
                <li><strong>Surprising fact:</strong> "In 2024, [counterintuitive data point]."</li>
                <li><strong>Direct question:</strong> "What happens when [scenario]?"</li>
                <li><strong>Human story:</strong> "When Maria lost her job..." (brief—10 seconds max)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Never start with:</strong> "Today I will argue that..." The judges already know.</p>
            <p><strong>If you blank:</strong> Start with your strongest single sentence. Anything confident beats throat-clearing.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Case structure for 5 minutes:</strong> You can't cover everything. Pick 2-3 strong contentions over 5 weak ones.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>0:00-0:15:</strong> Hook</li>
            <li><strong>0:15-0:45:</strong> Framework/definitions (only if necessary—skip if obvious)</li>
            <li><strong>0:45-2:00:</strong> Contention 1 (your strongest argument with evidence)</li>
            <li><strong>2:00-3:15:</strong> Contention 2 (your second strongest)</li>
            <li><strong>3:15-4:15:</strong> Contention 3 (or deepen 1 and 2 if only two are strong)</li>
            <li><strong>4:15-4:45:</strong> Anticipated objections ("They'll likely say X. Here's why that fails...")</li>
            <li><strong>4:45-5:00:</strong> Clear summary and voting issue</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Signposting for judges:</strong> They're taking notes. Help them.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"My first contention: [name it]."</li>
            <li>"For evidence, consider [source]."</li>
            <li>"This matters because [impact]."</li>
            <li>"Moving to my second contention..."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Evidence presentation:</strong> State the source, give the key finding, explain why it matters. "According to a 2023 MIT study, [finding]. This proves [claim] because [link]."
        </p>

            <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Anticipate in Your Constructive</div>
            <p>The best offense includes defense. Spend 30 seconds naming the most obvious attack and pre-refuting it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Name it:</strong> "The most common objection to this position is..."</li>
                <li><strong>Steelman it:</strong> "And it's a fair point—[acknowledge strength]."</li>
                <li><strong>Defeat it:</strong> "But here's what that critique misses..."</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> When your opponent raises this argument later, judges think "they already addressed that." Your opponent looks unprepared.</p>
            <p><strong>If you run out of time:</strong> Cut this section, not your strongest contention.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>During Cross-Examination (3 minutes)</h3>

        <p>
            Cross-ex is the most skill-intensive phase. You're either the examiner (asking questions) or the witness (answering them). Different roles, different rules.
        </p>

        <h4>When You're the Examiner</h4>

        <p>
            Your goal: establish facts you can weaponize in rebuttals. Not to make speeches. Not to argue. To get "yes" answers you'll use later.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Question Types</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The CX Toolkit</div>
            <p>Use these question types strategically:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clarifying questions:</strong> "When you said X, did you mean [interpretation A] or [interpretation B]?" — Use first to understand their position.</li>
                <li><strong>Testing questions:</strong> "Does your argument apply in [edge case]?" — Probes for logical limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Trapping questions:</strong> A sequence leading to a conclusion they can't escape. Plan these in advance.</li>
                <li><strong>Concession questions:</strong> "Would you agree that [obvious truth that helps you]?" — Locks in common ground.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The golden rule:</strong> Never ask a question you don't know the answer to. CX isn't discovery—it's confirmation.</p>
            <p><strong>If they evade:</strong> "I'll note for the judges that my opponent couldn't answer [simple question]." Then move on. Don't get stuck.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Setting up rebuttals during CX:</strong> Every question should serve your later speeches. Ask yourself: "How will I use this answer in my rebuttal?" If you don't know, don't ask.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example trap sequence:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"You argued we should prioritize economic growth, correct?" (Yes.)</li>
            <li>"And you'd agree growth should be sustainable?" (Yes.)</li>
            <li>"Sustainable means it can continue long-term?" (Yes.)</li>
            <li>"So if a policy delivers short-term growth but creates long-term collapse, that's not real growth by your own standard." (Trapped.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>When You're Being Examined</h4>

        <p>
            Your goal: give no ammunition. Concede nothing that hurts you. Stay controlled.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Defense Strategies</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Surviving CX</div>
            <p>Control techniques when being questioned:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Answer the question asked, not the question implied:</strong> "You asked if X is true. Yes. But if you're suggesting Y, that's a different question."</li>
                <li><strong>Clarify vague questions:</strong> "I want to answer accurately. When you say 'effective,' do you mean cost-effective or outcome-effective?"</li>
                <li><strong>Bridge back:</strong> "The answer is yes, but what's relevant here is [your talking point]."</li>
                <li><strong>Buy time legitimately:</strong> "Let me think about how to phrase this precisely." (2-3 seconds max)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>If you sense a trap:</strong> Ask them to state their full question. Sometimes making them lay it out exposes where they're going.</p>
            <p><strong>Never:</strong> Argue during CX. Answer briefly and move on. Your rebuttals are for arguments.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>"I don't know" responses that don't hurt you:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I don't have that specific statistic memorized, but my broader point stands because [reason]."</li>
            <li>"That's outside the scope of what I argued. My case doesn't depend on that detail."</li>
            <li>"I'd need to verify that specific claim, but even if it's true, it doesn't change [your core point]."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>During Rebuttals (3 minutes each)</h3>

        <p>
            Rebuttals are where debates are won or lost. You have 180 seconds to attack their case and defend yours. Prioritization is everything.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The 3-3-3 Rebuttal Rule</div>
            <p>Structure your 3 minutes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>First minute:</strong> Attack their weakest argument with your strongest response. Go for the kill.</li>
                <li><strong>Second minute:</strong> Defend your case against their best attack. Don't ignore what's working for them.</li>
                <li><strong>Third minute:</strong> Weigh and compare. "Even if they win X, my argument matters more because [impact]."</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>If running short:</strong> Skip defense on arguments they didn't attack. Drop your weakest points—judges notice when you can't defend everything.</p>
            <p><strong>If running long:</strong> Cut the weighing section before cutting attacks. Judges will weigh themselves if you've done the work.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Prioritizing which arguments to address:</strong> You can't answer everything. Use this hierarchy:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Must address:</strong> Anything that, if true, destroys your case entirely.</li>
            <li><strong>Should address:</strong> Their strongest point that judges might find persuasive.</li>
            <li><strong>Can ignore:</strong> Weak arguments, obvious stretches, anything tangential to the resolution.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <strong>The "even if" technique:</strong> This is your most powerful defensive move. It grants their premise while denying their conclusion.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"Even if their evidence is accurate, it doesn't prove [claim] because [gap]."</li>
            <li>"Even if we accept their framework, my case still wins because [reason]."</li>
            <li>"Even if that harm exists, my benefits outweigh because [impact comparison]."</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Extending your best arguments:</strong> Don't just repeat—develop. Add implications, respond to attacks, deepen the analysis.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"In my constructive I argued X. My opponent responded with Y. But Y fails because [reason], which means X still stands—and here's why it matters even more now: [new implication]."</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>During Closing (3 minutes)</h3>

        <p>
            The closing isn't a summary. It's your last chance to tell judges why they should vote for you. Make it count.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The Closing Checklist</div>
            <p>Structure for maximum impact:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lead with your ballot story (30 sec):</strong> "You should vote for me because [one sentence reason]."</li>
                <li><strong>Crystallize the clash (60 sec):</strong> "The debate came down to [key issue]. I won this because [reason]."</li>
                <li><strong>Voting issues (90 sec):</strong> "First, [issue]. Second, [issue]." Give judges a checklist.</li>
                <li><strong>Final impression (15 sec):</strong> End with something memorable. A callback. A principle. A question.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Never:</strong> Introduce new arguments. Judges will ignore them and penalize you for trying.</p>
            <p><strong>Always:</strong> Speak directly to judges. "When you evaluate this debate..." Make it about their decision.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Framing voting issues:</strong> Don't list everything you argued. Identify the 2-3 issues that decide the debate, and frame each one in your favor.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>"The first voting issue is impact. Even if you believe their arguments, my impacts are larger because [comparison]."</li>
            <li>"The second voting issue is evidence quality. My evidence is [stronger/more recent/more relevant] because [reason]."</li>
            <li>"The third voting issue is logical consistency. Their case relies on [contradiction]. Mine doesn't."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>ATTACK RESPONSES</h2>

        <p>
            When your opponent attacks you, you have seconds to choose a response. Here are the decision trees.
        </p>

        <h3>"They attacked my evidence"</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Diagnosis questions:</strong> Did they challenge the source? The methodology? The relevance? The recency?
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Response Options</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Evidence Under Attack</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Challenge their challenge:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>If they attacked the source:</em> "My source is [credible because]. Their critique doesn't address the actual findings."</li>
                        <li><em>If they attacked methodology:</em> "That's a fair question about any study. But [this methodology is standard/the sample size is sufficient/multiple studies confirm]."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Provide backup evidence:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Even setting that study aside, [second source] reaches the same conclusion."</li>
                        <li>"The trend is confirmed across multiple sources: [brief list]."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reframe the significance:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"My argument doesn't depend entirely on that evidence. The logical case is [reasoning that stands alone]."</li>
                        <li>"Even if that evidence is weaker than I claimed, it's still stronger than any evidence they've provided."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>If the attack lands:</strong> Concede gracefully and pivot. "Fair point on that study. But my core argument is [reasoning]. The evidence supported it; it isn't required for it."</p>
        </div>

        <h3>"They attacked my logic"</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Diagnosis questions:</strong> Did they find a genuine gap? Are they misrepresenting your argument? Is it a matter of unstated assumptions?
        </p>

            <div class="tactic-header">Response Options</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Logic Under Attack</div>
            <ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"I may not have been clear. The link between [A] and [B] is [explanation]."</li>
                        <li>"There's a step I assumed. Let me make it explicit: [unstated warrant]."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Accept partial critique, hold the line:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"That's a valid edge case. But the general principle still holds because [reason]."</li>
                        <li>"True, my framing was too absolute. A more precise statement is [refined claim]—and that still defeats their position."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Expose their logic gap:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"They say my logic fails—but they haven't explained why. What's the specific flaw?"</li>
                        <li>"Their critique assumes [premise they haven't proven]. Until they prove that, my logic stands."</li>

                </li>
            </ol>

        </div>

        <h3>"They attacked my credibility"</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Diagnosis questions:</strong> Are they questioning your expertise? Your motives? Your consistency?
        </p>

        <h2>DEFLECTION RESPONSES</h2>

        <p>
            Sometimes opponents don't attack your argument—they dodge it. Here's how to respond.
        </p>

        <h3>"They changed the subject"</h3>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Response Options</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Subject Change Detected</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Name it directly:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"That's interesting, but it doesn't address my point about [original issue]. Let me restate it."</li>
                        <li>"Judges will note my opponent is pivoting away from the central question: [resolution]."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Bridge back:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"[Brief acknowledgment of their tangent.] Now, returning to the actual issue..."</li>
                        <li>"I'll address that in a moment. First, let's resolve [core point] since that's what this debate is about."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Accept if advantageous:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If their new topic favors you: "Happy to discuss that too. [Your response on new topic.] But notice they've conceded my original point by not responding to it."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>When to let it go:</strong> If their tangent is weak and yours is strong, claim the original point as conceded and move on. Don't chase them.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>"They got emotional"</h3>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Response Options</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Emotional Escalation</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Validate the feeling:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"I can see this matters to you. It matters to me too. Let's work through it."</li>
                        <li>"That frustration is understandable given what's at stake. And here's why my position actually addresses those stakes..."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Separate emotion from logic:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"The passion is clear. But passion doesn't determine who's right. Let's look at the evidence."</li>
                        <li>"I share your concern about [underlying value]. I just disagree about the best way to address it."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>De-escalate:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lower your voice. Slow your pace. Measured tone wins against heated tone.</li>
                        <li>"Let's step back. We both want [common goal]. The question is how to get there."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Never:</strong> Match their emotional escalation. You lose even if you're right. Stay the calm one.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>"They appealed to authority"</h3>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Response Options</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Authority Appeals</div>

                <li><strong>Question relevance:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"[Expert] is respected in [their field]. But this is a question about [different field]. Why should their opinion carry special weight here?"</li>
                        <li>"That's one expert. Here are [other experts] who disagree. Expert consensus isn't on their side."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Provide counter-authority:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Actually, [more relevant expert] says [opposite]. And their expertise is more directly applicable because..."</li>
                        <li>"If we're citing authorities, let's note that [institution/study] contradicts that position."</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Focus on the argument itself:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Expert opinions help, but the argument still has to make sense. Why is the reasoning correct? Let's evaluate that."</li>
                        <li>"Even respected experts can be wrong. What's the actual evidence and logic here?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Trap to avoid:</strong> Don't dismiss expertise entirely—that looks anti-intellectual. Acknowledge the expert's credentials while questioning their application to this specific case.</p>

        <p>
            You made a mistake. You're losing. You don't know the answer. It happens. Here's how to recover.
        </p>

        <h3>"I'm losing the judges"</h3>

        <p>
            You can feel it—skeptical looks, judges not writing, body language shifting away. Time to recalibrate.

                        <li>Stories are memorable. Data can be contested; narratives stick.</li>

                        <li>Naming what judges are thinking builds credibility.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Signs you're losing:</strong> Judges stopped writing. They're looking at your opponent during your speech. They're checking the time. Adjust immediately.</p>

        <h2>OPPONENT TYPES</h2>

        <p>
            Different opponents require different strategies. Identify the type early and adjust your approach.
        </p>

        <h3>The Steamroller</h3>

        <p>
            Loud, interrupting, trying to dominate through sheer force. They talk over you and claim victory by volume.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Counter-Strategy</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Defeating the Steamroller</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Don't interrupt back:</strong> You can't out-volume them. You'll both look bad, but they're used to it. Stay composed.</li>
                <li><strong>Wait for an opening:</strong> They have to breathe. When they pause, insert your point calmly and directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Use clarifying questions:</strong> "I want to make sure I understand. Are you saying [restate clearly]?" Forces them to slow down.</li>
                <li><strong>Appeal to the judges:</strong> "I'll let my opponent finish, and then I'll respond." Makes their behavior visible.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The key insight:</strong> Steamrollers win by making you flustered. Stay calm and you win. Judges reward composure.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Gish Galloper</h3>

        <p>
            Throws 10 arguments in 60 seconds, hoping you can't address them all. Quantity over quality.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Counter-Strategy</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Defeating the Gish Galloper</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pick their strongest argument:</strong> Identify which one is actually dangerous. Attack only that one thoroughly.</li>
                <li><strong>Name the technique:</strong> "My opponent listed ten arguments in a minute. Notice that none were developed. Let me address the one that matters..."</li>
                <li><strong>The devastating line:</strong> "They threw ten arguments at you because they can't win on any single one. I can."</li>
                <li><strong>Don't chase:</strong> Attempting to respond to everything validates the approach. Focused depth beats scattered breadth.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The key insight:</strong> Gish Galloping only works if you accept the frame that you need to answer everything. Reject that frame.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Technical Debater</h3>

        <p>
            Relies on precise terminology, debate jargon, procedural arguments. Tries to win on technical grounds.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Counter-Strategy</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Defeating the Technical Debater</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Match precision where needed:</strong> If they define a term, you can too. Don't let them control all the definitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Expose overreach:</strong> "That's a technical argument, but does it hold up practically? In the real world, [counterexample]."</li>
                <li><strong>Appeal to common sense:</strong> "Setting aside the jargon, what my opponent is really saying is [plain language version]. Does that make sense?"</li>
                <li><strong>Question their framework:</strong> "They've set up a framework that happens to guarantee their win. But why should we accept that framework?"</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The key insight:</strong> Technical debates often hide weak substantive arguments. Force the substance to the surface.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>The Emotional Debater</h3>

        <p>
            Leads with stories, appeals to values, tries to make you look heartless if you disagree.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Counter-Strategy</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Defeating the Emotional Debater</div>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge the feeling:</strong> "That's a moving story. And it's exactly why we need to get this policy right—not just feel good about it."</li>
                <li><strong>Redirect to logic:</strong> "We both care about [value]. The question is which approach actually achieves it. Let's look at the evidence."</li>
                <li><strong>Use their energy:</strong> "My opponent's passion shows why this matters. And that passion should demand we look at what actually works."</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid looking cold:</strong> Show you care too—about evidence, about outcomes, about truth. Don't dismiss emotions; redirect them.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The key insight:</strong> You lose if you look heartless. You win if you care about outcomes more than feelings. Thread that needle.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-divider">
            <span class="line"></span>

                <li><strong>Use a bridge phrase:</strong> "Let me emphasize the key point here—" buys you 2 seconds to find your thread.</li>
                <li><strong>Return to your strongest argument:</strong> "What matters most is [your best point]." Judges won't penalize repetition of strong content.</li>
                <li><strong>If you can't recover:</strong> "I'll return to that point if time permits. Moving on—" No one expects perfection.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>What judges actually think:</strong> Brief pauses read as thoughtful. Panicked rambling reads as unprepared. Silence beats garbage.</p>

        <h3>You Forget Your Evidence</h3>

            <div class="tactic-title">Evidence Under Pressure</div>
            <p>You cited a study earlier. Now you can't remember the numbers. Options:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Generalize confidently:</strong> "The research consistently shows [general finding]" is better than fumbling for exact stats.</li>
                <li><strong>Use the hedge-and-pivot:</strong> "The exact figure is in my notes—but the trend is clear: [pattern]."</li>
                <li><strong>Callback without specifics:</strong> "As the MIT study I cited demonstrated..." Judges often remember you cited it even if they don't recall numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Worst case:</strong> "Multiple studies confirm this." Vague but not a lie. Move forward.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Never:</strong> Make up numbers. Judges may have written down what you actually said. Getting caught fabricating destroys credibility.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>You Mispronounce or Misspeak</h3>

            <div class="tactic-header">Recovery Protocol</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The Quick Correct</div>
            <p>You said the wrong name, mangled a word, or misstated your own position.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Correct immediately and move on:</strong> "—Piketty, rather. His research shows..." Don't dwell on it.</li>
                <li><strong>If you're not sure you erred:</strong> Keep going. Most missteps go unnoticed. Correcting a non-error wastes time.</li>
                <li><strong>If caught in CX:</strong> "I misspoke. What I meant was [correct version]." Honesty > defensiveness.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Judges have seen hundreds of debates. Minor stumbles don't matter. Recovery grace does.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>You're Losing the Judges</h3>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Recovery Protocol</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The Mid-Round Pivot</div>
            <p>You can feel it: confused faces, skeptical body language, judges not flowing. You're losing them.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Simplify immediately:</strong> "Let me put this simply: [one clear sentence]."</li>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge complexity:</strong> "I know this is dense. Here's what you need to remember: [core point]."</li>
                <li><strong>Tell a brief story:</strong> Humans respond to narrative. "Consider what this means in practice: [30-second concrete example]."</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat your voting issue:</strong> "At the end of this round, ask yourself one question: [your framing]. That's what I'm proving."</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Warning sign:</strong> If judges stop writing, you've lost them. Change something—pace, content, energy.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>CX Under Cognitive Load</h3>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Recovery Protocol</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Real-Time CX Survival</div>
            <p>Cross-examination is the only phase where you can't call prep time. Your brain is splitting: listen, think, respond, plan. Here's how to survive:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>When you don't understand:</strong> "Can you rephrase that?" is always legitimate. It also buys 5 seconds.</li>
                <li><strong>When you don't know:</strong> "I'd need to see the specific evidence to address that" is better than guessing.</li>
                <li><strong>When trapped:</strong> "I see where you're going. Let me clarify my actual position—" Don't answer the question as asked if it's a trap.</li>
                <li><strong>When being rapid-fired:</strong> "Let me answer your first question fully before we move on." Slows their pace.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The secret:</strong> You don't have to answer every question the way they want. You have to look reasonable while protecting your case. Judges reward composure, not compliance.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Your Opponent Made a Point You Can't Answer</h3>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Recovery Protocol</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The Strategic Concession</div>
            <p>They made a genuinely good point. You don't have a response. Now what?</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Concede narrowly:</strong> "That's fair on [specific sub-point]. But notice it doesn't touch [your main argument]."</li>
                <li><strong>Reframe stakes:</strong> "Even granting their point, the question remains: [bigger issue they haven't addressed]."</li>
                <li><strong>Minimize impact:</strong> "Interesting point. But does it change the outcome? My core case still stands because [reason]."</li>
                <li><strong>What NOT to do:</strong> Pretend it didn't happen. Judges noticed. Ignoring strong arguments looks evasive.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Remember:</strong> You don't need to win every argument. You need to win the debate. Strategic concession can actually build credibility.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>You're Running Out of Time</h3>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Recovery Protocol</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The 30-Second Crunch</div>
            <p>You have 30 seconds left and two more arguments to cover. Triage:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Drop your weakest remaining point.</strong> Don't mention it. Judges won't miss what they never heard.</li>
                <li><strong>Hit your voting issue:</strong> "Here's what this comes down to: [single sentence]."</li>
                <li><strong>Trust your best argument:</strong> If you made one strong point well, trust it. Don't dilute with rushed additions.</li>
                <li><strong>End with confidence:</strong> A strong final sentence beats two mumbled points. "For these reasons, I urge a [affirmative/negative] decision."</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Never:</strong> Speed up so much judges can't follow. A clear 80% beats a garbled 100%.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>THE UNIVERSAL RESPONSE FRAMEWORK</h2>

        <p>
            When none of the above fits, or you need a general structure, use this:
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The A-R-E Framework</div>
            <p>For any argument you face, respond with:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Acknowledge:</strong> "I understand the point you're making about [X]."</li>
                <li><strong>Respond:</strong> "Here's why that doesn't hold: [your response]."</li>
                <li><strong>Extend:</strong> "And this actually supports my position because [connection to your case]."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This three-step move is ancient. Cicero used it in his orations against Catiline—acknowledge the force of opposition, show why it fails, return to your case. It works because it respects your audience's intelligence while holding your ground. Aristotle would have recognized it as building <em>ethos</em> through fairness.</p>
            <p>Takes 15-30 seconds per argument. Works on anything. Practice it until it's automatic.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> "I understand the concern about cost. But the research shows these programs pay for themselves within five years. And that long-term savings is exactly why my framework of sustainable policy should guide this debate."</p>

            <span class="exercise-type reflection">Reflection</span>
            <h4>Identify Your Default Response</h4>
            <p>Think about your last three disagreements. When challenged, did you tend to (a) defend immediately, (b) deflect to another topic, (c) concede too quickly, or (d) get emotional? Understanding your default helps you break unproductive patterns. Write down which pattern dominates and one specific situation where a different response would have worked better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <span class="exercise-type dialogue-completion">Practice</span>
            <h4>Response Drill</h4>
            <p>Set a timer for 30 seconds. Have someone read you one of these attacks: "Your evidence is outdated," "That logic doesn't follow," "You're only saying that because of your background." Respond immediately using the A-R-E framework. Practice until you can deliver smooth responses without hesitation. Record yourself and review for filler words and clarity.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="exercise">
            <span class="exercise-type challenge">Challenge</span>
            <h4>Opponent Type Simulation</h4>
            <p>Find a practice partner. Have them roleplay each opponent type (Steamroller, Gish Galloper, Technical, Emotional) for 2 minutes while you respond. After each round, debrief: What worked? What didn't? Then switch roles. Experiencing both sides deepens your understanding of the dynamics.</p>
