        <p>
            The Debate Guide is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data we collect, why we collect it, and how we use it.
        </p>

        <h2>THE SHORT VERSION</h2>

        <p>
            We collect minimal data. We don't sell your information. We don't use invasive tracking. We respect your privacy as we'd want ours respected.
        </p>

        <h2>WHAT WE COLLECT</h2>

        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>
            If you contact us via email or social media, we receive whatever information you choose to share. We use this only to respond to your inquiry.
        </p>

        <h3>Automatic Information</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> We store your reading preferences (theme, font size) and reading progress locally in your browser. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any server.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Analytics:</strong> {% if site.analyticsEnabled %}We use Plausible Analytics, a privacy-focused analytics service that doesn't use cookies, doesn't track individuals, and is fully GDPR compliant. We see aggregate data like page views and referral sources—we cannot identify individual visitors.{% else %}We do not currently use any analytics or tracking services.{% endif %}
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Service Worker:</strong> We use a service worker to enable offline reading. This caches pages you visit on your device for faster loading and offline access. No data is sent to our servers.
        </p>
