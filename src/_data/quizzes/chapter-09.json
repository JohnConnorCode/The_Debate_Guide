      "question": "What is an enthymeme?",
      "options": [
        "A logical fallacy",
        "A rhetorical syllogism with an implied premise",
        "An emotional appeal disguised as logic",
        "A type of evidence"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "An enthymeme is a syllogism where one premise is left unstated because it's assumed the audience already accepts it. Example: 'She's a politician, so she can't be trusted' implies the unstated premise that all politicians are untrustworthy."

      "id": "ch9-q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Deductive reasoning moves from specific observations to general conclusions.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "Deductive reasoning moves from general principles to specific conclusions. Inductive reasoning moves from specific observations to general conclusions."

    {
      "id": "ch9-q3",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which of the following is the strongest form of evidence for a logos-based argument?",
      "options": [
        "A celebrity endorsement",
        "An emotional anecdote",
        "Peer-reviewed research data",
        "A popular opinion poll"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Peer-reviewed research represents systematically gathered and verified evidence, making it the strongest foundation for logical arguments."

      "id": "ch9-q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "'All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.' This is an example of:",
      "options": [
        "Inductive reasoning",
        "Deductive reasoning (syllogism)",
        "Analogical reasoning",
        "Abductive reasoning"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "This is a classic deductive syllogism: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion that necessarily follows if both premises are true."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch9-q5",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "A logically valid argument always has true conclusions.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "Validity refers to the structure of an argument—whether the conclusion follows from the premises. An argument can be valid but have false premises, leading to a false conclusion. Soundness requires both validity AND true premises."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch9-q6",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "When you argue that 'just as exercise strengthens the body, reading strengthens the mind,' you are using:",
      "options": [
        "Deductive reasoning",
        "Inductive reasoning",
        "Analogical reasoning",
        "Circular reasoning"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Analogical reasoning draws parallels between two things to suggest that what's true of one is likely true of the other. The strength depends on how similar the compared things actually are."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch9-q7",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the main weakness of relying solely on logos in persuasion?",
      "options": [
        "Logic is too complicated for audiences",
        "Humans are not purely rational decision-makers",
        "Evidence is always biased",
        "Syllogisms take too long to construct"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "While logos provides the rational foundation, humans make decisions based on emotions, identity, and social factors too. Effective persuasion combines logos with ethos and pathos."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch9-q8",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "The difference between validity and soundness in an argument is:",
      "options": [
        "Validity refers to evidence quality; soundness refers to structure",
        "Valid arguments have true conclusions; sound arguments have false ones",
        "Validity concerns structure; soundness requires both valid structure AND true premises",
        "There is no meaningful difference"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "A valid argument has correct logical structure (conclusion follows from premises). A sound argument is valid AND has true premises. You can have a valid argument with false premises that leads to a false conclusion."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch9-q9",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Abductive reasoning, or 'inference to the best explanation,' gives us certain conclusions like deductive reasoning.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "Abductive reasoning identifies the most likely explanation for observed facts but doesn't guarantee certainty. Unlike deduction, which is conclusive when valid, abduction produces probable conclusions that could be wrong if a better explanation emerges."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch9-q10",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "When constructing a logical argument, what should you do with the unstated premises your audience must accept?",
      "options": [
        "Avoid relying on any unstated premises",
        "Choose structures that rely on premises the audience already holds",
        "State every premise explicitly, no matter how obvious",
        "Use premises the audience will likely reject to challenge them"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Effective rhetorical logic builds on beliefs the audience already accepts. Enthymemes work by leaving widely-accepted premises unstated. If your argument depends on premises your audience rejects, you must establish those premises first."
