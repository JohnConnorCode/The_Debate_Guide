        "Change the subject"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The Socratic method avoids direct contradiction. Instead, you ask questions that help the person examine their own reasoning and discover inconsistencies themselves."

      "question": "The goal of Socratic questioning is always to prove the other person wrong.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The goal is truth-seeking and mutual understanding, not 'winning.' Socrates was as willing to discover his own errors as those of his interlocutors. The method aims at clarity, not defeat."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Good Socratic questions are genuinely curious, non-judgmental, and seek clarification. 'What do you mean by that?' invites the person to examine and articulate their thinking."
