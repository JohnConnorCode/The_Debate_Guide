      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What distinguishes the 'philosopher's victory' from mere rhetorical success?",
      "options": [
        "It involves more sophisticated vocabulary",
        "It prioritizes truth-seeking and mutual understanding over winning",
        "It only occurs in academic philosophy departments",
        "It means never persuading anyone of anything"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The philosopher's victory occurs when dialogue leads to better understanding—even if positions don't change, even if you're the one who changes. It values the quality of reasoning over the outcome of persuasion, seeing rhetoric as a collaborative pursuit of truth rather than intellectual combat."

      "id": "ch20-q2",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How did Socrates primarily 'win' his dialogues according to the Platonic tradition?",
      "options": [
        "By having the best rhetorical techniques",
        "By asking questions that led interlocutors to discover truth themselves",
        "By speaking louder and longer than others",
        "By appealing to the authority of the gods"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Socrates rarely asserted his own views. Instead, he asked questions that helped others examine their beliefs, discover contradictions, and work toward clearer understanding. His 'victory' was helping others think better, not defeating them in argument."

      "id": "ch20-q3",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "If you change your mind during a debate based on good arguments, you have lost.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "From the philosophical perspective, changing your mind in response to good arguments is intellectual victory, not defeat. You've achieved the goal of better understanding. The person who clings to refuted positions to avoid 'losing' has actually failed the deeper purpose of reasoned discourse."

    {
      "id": "ch20-q4",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the relationship between rhetoric and ethics in the classical tradition?",
      "options": [
        "They are completely separate domains",
        "Rhetoric is inherently unethical because it involves persuasion",
        "True eloquence requires both persuasive skill and moral character",
        "Ethical people have no need for rhetorical training"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Quintilian's 'good man speaking well' encapsulates the tradition: genuine eloquence integrates technical skill with moral purpose. Rhetoric without ethics becomes dangerous sophistry; ethics without rhetoric lacks the power to do good in the world. They are inseparable in the ideal orator."

    {
      "id": "ch20-q5",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Why might being 'less wrong' be a valuable outcome of debate?",
      "options": [
        "It's the only realistic goal since truth is unknowable",
        "Recognizing and correcting errors is genuine intellectual progress",
        "Being less wrong is the same as being right",
        "It allows you to claim partial victory"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Intellectual progress often means reducing error rather than achieving certainty. If debate helps you discard a false belief, refine an imprecise view, or recognize complexity you'd ignored, you've genuinely advanced—even without reaching final truth. This is real philosophical victory."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch20-q6",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "The philosopher's approach to argument means never advocating strongly for any position.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "Philosophical commitment to truth-seeking doesn't mean wishy-washy fence-sitting. You can argue vigorously for positions you've carefully considered while remaining genuinely open to counter-evidence. The key is that your commitment follows from reasoning, not that you avoid commitment."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch20-q7",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What does it mean to treat an interlocutor as a 'partner in inquiry' rather than an opponent?",
      "options": [
        "Refusing to disagree with anything they say",
        "Seeing disagreement as collaborative exploration rather than combat",
        "Only debating with people who already agree with you",
        "Speaking less so they can speak more"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Partners in inquiry work together toward understanding, even through vigorous disagreement. Challenges become contributions; counterarguments become gifts that strengthen thinking. This framing transforms the emotional dynamic of debate from adversarial to collaborative."

    {
      "id": "ch20-q8",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "How does intellectual humility relate to the philosopher's approach to rhetoric?",
      "options": [
        "Humble people shouldn't engage in rhetoric",
        "Humility means recognizing you might be wrong while still arguing for your best current view",
        "Humility and confidence are opposites",
        "Intellectual humility is only required of students, not experts"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Intellectual humility means holding views tentatively enough that evidence could change them, while still advocating for your best current understanding. It's not weakness but epistemic honesty—acknowledging uncertainty while still participating fully in the pursuit of truth."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch20-q9",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "What is the ultimate purpose of studying rhetoric according to the philosophical tradition?",
      "options": [
        "Career advancement through persuasive skill",
        "Winning more arguments than you lose",
        "Becoming more effective at pursuing and communicating truth",
        "Manipulating others without their awareness"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The deepest purpose of rhetorical education is not merely to win arguments but to think better, seek truth more effectively, and communicate that truth persuasively. Rhetoric in this tradition is an instrument of wisdom, not merely of power."
    },
    {
      "id": "ch20-q10",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "The philosopher's victory means you should be equally satisfied whether you persuade others or are persuaded by them.",
      "correct": true,
      "explanation": "If the goal is truth and understanding, then being corrected serves that goal as much as correcting others. Genuine philosophers welcome having their errors exposed—it brings them closer to truth. The outcome of who persuaded whom matters less than whether understanding advanced."
