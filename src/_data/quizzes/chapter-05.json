      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "According to Aristotle, ethos is established through three qualities. Which is NOT one of them?",
      "options": [
        "Phronesis (practical wisdom)",
        "Arete (virtue/moral character)",
        "Eunoia (goodwill toward audience)",
        "Dynamis (personal power)"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "Aristotle identified phronesis (practical wisdom), arete (virtue), and eunoia (goodwill) as the three components of ethos. Dynamis is not part of his framework."

      "id": "ch5-q2",
      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "Ethos only comes from your reputation before you speak; you cannot build it during a speech.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "While prior reputation helps, Aristotle emphasized that ethos is primarily built through the speech itself—through demonstrated knowledge, fair treatment of opposing views, and genuine concern for the audience."

        "Steelmanning opposing views",
        "Ignoring objections"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Steelmanning—presenting the strongest version of opposing arguments before addressing them—demonstrates intellectual honesty and builds credibility."

      "question": "A doctor citing their medical degree when giving health advice is an example of:",
      "options": [
        "Intrinsic ethos",
        "Extrinsic ethos",
        "Pathos",
        "Logos"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Extrinsic ethos comes from external credentials, reputation, or status that exists before the speech. A medical degree is an external qualification."

      "question": "Admitting uncertainty or limitations in your knowledge can actually strengthen your ethos.",
      "correct": true,

        "That physical challenges prevent persuasion",
        "The superiority of written over spoken rhetoric"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Demosthenes's story shows that credibility and skill can be developed through persistent effort. He became ancient Greece's greatest orator despite initial disadvantages."

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "question": "Which action would most damage a speaker's ethos?",
      "options": [
        "Acknowledging a valid point from an opponent",
        "Using technical language the audience understands",
        "Being caught in a factual inaccuracy",
        "Showing emotion about the topic"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Factual inaccuracies directly undermine the perception of competence and honesty—two core components of ethos. Once trust is broken, it's difficult to rebuild."
