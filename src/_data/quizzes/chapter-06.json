      "options": [
        "Because how you treat your opponent reveals your character to the audience more clearly than what you say about yourself",
        "Because opponents always have better arguments than you",
        "Because debates should end in complete agreement",
        "Because opponents can help you avoid making arguments"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter opens: 'Your opponent is your greatest ally... the way you treat your opponent reveals your character more clearly than anything you say about yourself. An audience watches how you handle opposition, and they draw conclusions.'",

        "What does the audience learn by watching how you treat opponents?",
        "The chapter emphasizes showing character rather than claiming it."

      "options": [
        "The rhetorical move of acknowledging the validity of an opponent's point or the weakness of your own",
        "Surrendering the entire debate",
        "Agreeing with everything your opponent says",

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The vocabulary box defines concession as: 'The rhetorical move of acknowledging the validity of an opponent's point or the weakness of your own. Counterintuitively, strategic concession often strengthens your overall position by demonstrating fairness and intellectual honesty.'",
      "hints": [

      "type": "true-false",
      "question": "According to the chapter, acknowledging uncertainty in your argument makes you sound weak and should be avoided.",
      "correct": false,
      "explanation": "The chapter argues the opposite: 'A speaker who pretends to certainty they don't actually have sounds like a salesperson. A speaker who honestly acknowledges what they don't know sounds like someone searching for truth.' Scientists routinely include limitations sections, which 'far from weakening the work... strengthen it.'",
      "hints": [

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The Quick Tactic lists four character-building moves, including: 'Return to past errors: \"Remember when I said X? I've updated my thinking because...\"' The chapter notes: 'None of these cost you anything. All of them compound into reputation.'",

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter describes Lincoln facing 'a sophisticated New York audience skeptical of the prairie lawyer from Illinois.' Rather than listing credentials, 'he launched into a meticulous historical analysis... building his case brick by careful brick. By the time he finished, the audience had experienced his character through his reasoning.'",

        "Never disagreeing with anyone publicly"

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains: 'When someone's words are ambiguous, interpret them in the most favorable light. When their argument has weaknesses, focus on the strongest version rather than the weakest. The principle isn't about being nice; it's about being effective.'",

      "explanation": "The chapter quotes Dennett: 'You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, \"Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way.\"' This demonstrates both expertise and fairness.",

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The chapter explains that Jordan 'began by acknowledging what she found impressive in Nixon's record, what legitimate concerns his defenders might have, and how seriously she took her constitutional oath.' Her statement showed 'character as argument'—her credibility rested entirely on who she was.",

      "explanation": "Russell's quote states the opposite: 'The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.' The chapter uses this to argue that 'intellectual humility stands out' and 'honesty about uncertainty can cut through suspicion.'",
