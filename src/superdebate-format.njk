        <p>
            SuperDebate is where ancient rhetoric meets modern competition. The 28-minute structure mirrors classical oratory: your constructive speech is the formal <em>oration</em>—case building, evidence, impact. Your cross-examination is <em>elenchus</em>—the Socratic refutation through questioning. Your rebuttals are <em>dialectic</em>—the back-and-forth clash that reveals truth under pressure. The format is new; the skills it rewards are 2,400 years old.
        </p>

        <p>
            What judges want is what Aristotle identified as the only things that persuade: <em>logos</em> (sound reasoning), <em>ethos</em> (credibility under pressure), and <em>pathos</em> (making the audience care). The 28 minutes are just structure. Excellence is ancient.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether you're preparing for your first tournament or refining your approach after dozens, understanding the format is foundational. Strategy without format mastery is guesswork.

        <h2>FORMAT OVERVIEW</h2>

        <p>
            A SuperDebate round is 28 minutes of structured argument. Both debaters speak multiple times, in different modes: constructing cases, questioning opponents, attacking arguments, and making final appeals. The format rewards versatility.

        <p>
            The 10 minutes of prep time is your strategic reserve. You can use it before any speech. Smart distribution often determines the round more than raw debating skill.

            <p>Don't frontload all your prep. Recommended distribution:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Before Constructive:</strong> 2-3 minutes (outline your case, plan opening)</li>
                <li><strong>Before Rebuttals:</strong> 2-3 minutes each (plan attacks, prioritize responses)</li>
                <li><strong>Reserve:</strong> Keep 1-2 minutes for emergencies (unexpected arguments, needed recovery)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Using 5+ minutes before your constructive, leaving nothing for rebuttals when you need it most.</p>

        <h2>PHASE-BY-PHASE GUIDE</h2>

        <h3>Constructive Speech (5 minutes)</h3>

        <p>
            Your constructive is your foundation. Everything else builds on it or attacks it. A weak constructive limits what you can achieve in rebuttals. A strong one gives you ammunition for the entire round.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What judges want:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> They should know your position within 30 seconds</li>
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> Numbered contentions they can flow (take notes on)</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence:</strong> Specific support for each claim, not just assertions</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Why your arguments matter—so what?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>What judges penalize:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Vague thesis or unclear position</li>
            <li>Assertions without evidence</li>
            <li>Too many underdeveloped arguments (3 strong beats 6 weak)</li>
            <li>Running out of time mid-argument</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Time Template</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The 5-Minute Constructive</div>
            <p>Allocate your 300 seconds:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>0:00-0:20:</strong> Hook and thesis</li>
                <li><strong>0:20-0:40:</strong> Framework/definitions (only if contested or necessary)</li>
                <li><strong>0:40-2:00:</strong> Contention 1 (claim, warrant, evidence, impact)</li>
                <li><strong>2:00-3:20:</strong> Contention 2</li>
                <li><strong>3:20-4:20:</strong> Contention 3 or deeper development of 1 and 2</li>
                <li><strong>4:20-4:45:</strong> Preemptive defense (anticipated objection)</li>
                <li><strong>4:45-5:00:</strong> Summary and call to vote</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Practice this:</strong> Record yourself delivering a case. Stop at each timestamp. Did you hit your marks? Adjust until the timing is natural.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            <strong>Common mistakes:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The slow start:</strong> Spending 90 seconds on definitions and background before getting to substance. Judges tune out.</li>
            <li><strong>The evidence dump:</strong> Listing facts without explaining why they matter. Data isn't argument.</li>
            <li><strong>The kitchen sink:</strong> Throwing every argument you can think of. Depth beats breadth.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cross-Examination (3 minutes)</h3>

        <p>
            Cross-ex separates good debaters from great ones. In 180 seconds, you must establish facts you'll use to destroy their case in rebuttals. No pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Rules to know:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The examiner controls the time; the witness must answer directly</li>
            <li>Questions only—no speeches disguised as questions</li>
            <li>The witness should answer the question asked, not the question they wish was asked</li>
            <li>Judges are watching for both substance and demeanor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>What judges want to see from examiners:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purposeful questions (each one serves your rebuttal)</li>
            <li>Control without bullying</li>
            <li>Ability to get concessions</li>
            <li>Adaptability when the witness doesn't cooperate</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>What judges want to see from witnesses:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Direct answers (dodging is obvious and looks bad)</li>
            <li>Composure under pressure</li>
            <li>Brief, accurate responses without volunteering extra information</li>
            <li>Not getting trapped into damaging admissions</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The Question Funnel</div>
            <p>Structure your CX as a funnel—broad to narrow:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Clarifying (30 sec):</strong> Establish what they actually argued</li>
                <li><strong>Testing (60 sec):</strong> Probe limits of their logic</li>
                <li><strong>Trapping (60 sec):</strong> Lock them into damaging positions</li>
                <li><strong>Confirming (30 sec):</strong> Repeat key admissions for the judges' notes</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Exit strategy:</strong> If a line of questioning isn't working, don't push. Say "Moving on," and try another angle. Persistence looks worse than pivoting.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>First Rebuttal (3 minutes)</h3>

        <p>
            Rebuttals are the heart of clash. You must simultaneously defend your case and attack theirs. Three minutes is not enough for everything—so you must prioritize.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What judges want:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Direct engagement:</strong> Address what they said, not what you wish they said</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Hit the important arguments, not everything</li>
            <li><strong>Line-by-line:</strong> Work through their contentions systematically</li>
            <li><strong>Extensions:</strong> Develop your own arguments further, don't just repeat</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>The strategic choice:</strong> Attack first or defend first?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attack first</strong> if their case is weak—put them on defense</li>
            <li><strong>Defend first</strong> if your case is under heavy fire—stabilize before attacking</li>
            <li>Most rounds: Split the difference. Brief defense, then attack, then extend</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The Rebuttal Triage</div>
            <p>You can't respond to everything. Sort arguments into three buckets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Must answer:</strong> Arguments that destroy your case if unchallenged (spend 60-90 seconds here)</li>
                <li><strong>Should answer:</strong> Arguments judges might find persuasive (spend 30-60 seconds)</li>
                <li><strong>Can ignore:</strong> Weak arguments, tangents, obvious stretches (spend 0 seconds—let them die)</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The judgment call:</strong> If you're unsure whether to address something, ask: "If I don't respond, will judges assume I can't?" If yes, respond. If no, skip it.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Closing Rebuttal (3 minutes)</h3>

        <p>
            Your last word. No new arguments—judges will ignore them and you'll look desperate. This is about crystallization: giving judges a clear reason to vote for you.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What judges want:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voting issues:</strong> Clear criteria for their decision</li>
            <li><strong>Weighing:</strong> Why your arguments matter more than theirs</li>
            <li><strong>Synthesis:</strong> How the round fits together</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> You believe you've won (without arrogance)</li>
        </ul>

                <li><strong>1:30-2:30:</strong> Voting issue #2 (their weakest point, why it matters)</li>
                <li><strong>2:30-2:50:</strong> Final weighing—even if they win X, you still win because Y</li>
                <li><strong>2:50-3:00:</strong> Memorable close (callback to opening, principle, or direct appeal)</li>

        <h2>SCORING CRITERIA DEEP DIVE</h2>

        <p>
            SuperDebate judges evaluate three dimensions. These aren't arbitrary—they map directly to what Aristotle identified as the foundations of persuasion. <strong>Argument Quality</strong> is <em>logos</em> (the soundness of your reasoning). <strong>Refutation Effectiveness</strong> is <em>elenchus</em> (the Socratic art of testing claims). <strong>Delivery</strong> is <em>ethos</em> and <em>pathos</em> combined (your credibility and connection with the audience). The Greeks figured out what persuades. Modern judges measure it.
        </p>

        <h3>Argument Quality <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; opacity: 0.7;">(Logos)</span></h3>

        <p>
            This is the substance of what you're saying. Do your arguments make sense? Are they well-supported? Do they address the resolution? Aristotle called this <em>logos</em>—the appeal to reason and evidence.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What earns high marks:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear claims with explicit warrants (the "because" is always visible)</li>
            <li>Specific evidence from credible sources</li>
            <li>Impact analysis—so what? Why does this matter?</li>
            <li>Internal consistency (your arguments support each other)</li>
            <li>Topicality (arguments directly address the resolution)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>What costs you points:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assertions without support ("This is obviously true")</li>
            <li>Logical gaps between evidence and conclusion</li>
            <li>Contradicting yourself across speeches</li>
            <li>Tangential arguments that don't serve the resolution</li>
            <li>Misrepresenting evidence or opponent's position</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="featured-quote">
            <blockquote>
                An argument is not the same as an assertion. An assertion says something is true. An argument explains why.
            </blockquote>
            <cite>The distinction every judge holds you to</cite>
        </div>

        <h3>Refutation Effectiveness <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; opacity: 0.7;">(Elenchus)</span></h3>

        <p>
            Can you engage with and defeat opposing arguments? This is where debates are won. The Greeks called this <em>elenchus</em>—the Socratic refutation. You're testing your opponent's claims through logical pressure, exposing weaknesses, and demonstrating that their conclusions don't follow from their premises.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What earns high marks:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Directly engaging what your opponent actually said (not strawmanning)</li>
            <li>Explaining why their evidence or logic fails</li>
            <li>Turning arguments—using their points against them</li>
            <li>Weighing—showing why your arguments matter more even if theirs are true</li>
            <li>Extending your arguments in response to attacks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>What costs you points:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ignoring strong opposing arguments</li>
            <li>Simply contradicting without explanation ("That's wrong")</li>
            <li>Attacking strawmen versions of their position</li>
            <li>Dropping arguments (failing to respond to attacks on your case)</li>
            <li>Ad hominem attacks or personal attacks</li>

            <div class="tactic-title">The Refutation Checklist</div>
            <p>For each major opposing argument, ask:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Is the evidence weak?</strong> Challenge source, methodology, or relevance</li>
                <li><strong>Is the logic flawed?</strong> Show the gap between premise and conclusion</li>
                <li><strong>Can I turn it?</strong> Does their point actually support my side?</li>
                <li><strong>Can I minimize it?</strong> Even if true, does it matter?</li>
                <li><strong>Can I outweigh it?</strong> Is my argument more important?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>One of these five will work. Pick the strongest and commit to it.</p>

        <h3>Delivery <span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 0.8em; opacity: 0.7;">(Ethos + Pathos)</span></h3>

        <p>
            How you say it matters. Not more than substance—but enough to tip close rounds. This is where <em>ethos</em> (your credibility) and <em>pathos</em> (your connection with the audience) become visible. Aristotle knew that the same argument delivered with confidence and clarity persuades more than one mumbled at the floor. Delivery isn't theater—it's the physical manifestation of your conviction.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>What earns high marks:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Every word is audible and understandable</li>
            <li><strong>Pace:</strong> Fast enough to cover ground, slow enough to follow</li>
            <li><strong>Presence:</strong> You look like you belong there, comfortable and engaged</li>
            <li><strong>Eye contact:</strong> With judges, not your notes or the floor</li>
            <li><strong>Vocal variety:</strong> Emphasis on key points, not monotone</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>What costs you points:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mumbling, trailing off, or speaking too quietly</li>
            <li>Speaking so fast judges can't flow (take notes)</li>
            <li>Reading from a script without looking up</li>
            <li>Visible nervousness that distracts from content</li>
            <li>Arrogance, dismissiveness, or rudeness</li>
        </ul>

            <div class="tactic-title">The Delivery Reset</div>
            <p>When you feel yourself rushing, losing composure, or going flat:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pause.</strong> A deliberate 2-second pause is powerful, not weak.</li>
                <li><strong>Breathe.</strong> One deep breath resets your pace.</li>
                <li><strong>Find a friendly face.</strong> Make eye contact with one judge.</li>
                <li><strong>Slow your next sentence.</strong> The reset cascades.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>The paradox:</strong> Slowing down when nervous actually makes you sound more confident, not less.</p>

        <h2>COMMON TOPICS</h2>

        <p>
            SuperDebate draws from recurring subject areas. Building familiarity with these domains gives you an edge—you won't be starting from zero when topics are announced.

            </ol>
            <p>Do this prep for the four topic areas above, and you'll rarely face a resolution cold.</p>

        <h2>FIRST TOURNAMENT CHECKLIST</h2>

        <p>
            Your first competition is about learning, not winning. But being prepared helps you learn better. Here's what to bring and know.
        </p>

        <h3>What to Bring</h3>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Timer:</strong> Your phone works, but a dedicated timer is less distracting</li>
            <li><strong>Flowing materials:</strong> Legal pad or dedicated flow paper, multiple pens (they die at critical moments)</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Dry throat derails speeches</li>
            <li><strong>Snacks:</strong> Tournament days are long; hunger destroys focus</li>
            <li><strong>Backup research:</strong> Notes on common topics, key quotes, evidence you've gathered</li>
            <li><strong>Comfortable clothes:</strong> You'll be sitting, standing, and stressing—dress for it</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Flow</h3>

        <p>
            "Flowing" is debate shorthand for taking notes during a round. Good flows win debates.
        </p>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">Basic Flowing</div>
            <p>Set up your paper in columns:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Column 1:</strong> Your constructive arguments</li>
                <li><strong>Column 2:</strong> Their responses to your arguments</li>
                <li><strong>Column 3:</strong> Your responses to their responses</li>
                <li><strong>Opposite side of paper:</strong> Same structure for their case</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Abbreviate heavily. "Inc" for "increase," "gov" for "government," arrows for causal relationships. Your flow is for you—it doesn't need to be readable by anyone else.</p>
            <p><strong>Key habit:</strong> Put a star next to arguments you plan to attack. Put an X next to arguments you plan to drop. This triage saves thinking time during prep.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Managing Nerves</h3>

        <p>
            Everyone is nervous at their first tournament. The debaters who look confident are just better at hiding it. Some practical approaches:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arrive early:</strong> Rushing amplifies anxiety</li>
            <li><strong>Watch a round first:</strong> If possible, observe others before your first round</li>
            <li><strong>Physical reset:</strong> Before your round, find a private spot and do 10 slow breaths</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on process:</strong> Don't think "I need to win." Think "I need to give my constructive, then do CX, then give my rebuttal." One task at a time.</li>
            <li><strong>Permission to fail:</strong> Your first tournament is reconnaissance. You're gathering data for improvement, not defending a record.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="quick-tactic">
            <div class="tactic-header">Quick Tactic</div>
            <div class="tactic-title">The Pre-Round Ritual</div>
            <p>Five minutes before your round:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Review your opening line.</strong> Know exactly how you'll start.</li>
                <li><strong>Check your materials.</strong> Timer ready, paper ready, pen works.</li>
                <li><strong>Physical check.</strong> Bathroom, water, adjust clothing.</li>
                <li><strong>Mental check.</strong> Three deep breaths, then "I'm ready."</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Rituals reduce anxiety by creating predictability. Design yours and stick to it.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>After the Round</h3>

        <p>
            Win or lose, you're not done. The post-round process is where improvement happens.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ask for feedback:</strong> If judges offer comments, listen without defensiveness</li>
            <li><strong>Debrief immediately:</strong> Write down what worked and what didn't while it's fresh</li>
            <li><strong>Save your flows:</strong> They're a record of the round for later analysis</li>
            <li><strong>Don't dwell:</strong> Process it, learn from it, then move on to the next round</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Pre-Tournament Self-Assessment</h4>
            <p>Before your first (or next) tournament, rate yourself 1-5 on: (1) Constructive speech structure, (2) Cross-examination questioning, (3) Cross-examination answering, (4) Rebuttal prioritization, (5) Closing summary. Identify your lowest score. That's your practice priority. After the tournament, rate again and compare.</p>

            <span class="exercise-type dialogue-completion">Practice</span>
            <h4>Timed Speech Drill</h4>
            <p>Pick any topic you have an opinion on. Set a timer for exactly 5 minutes. Deliver a constructive speech hitting the time template: hook by 0:20, contention 1 by 2:00, contention 2 by 3:20, summary by 4:45. Record yourself and review. Where did you run long? Where did you have time to spare? Repeat until the timing is natural.</p>

            <span class="exercise-type challenge">Challenge</span>
            <h4>Full Round Simulation</h4>
            <p>Find a practice partner. Run a complete 28-minute round with proper timing and prep time. Flow each other's speeches. Afterward, debrief: What arguments landed? What fell flat? What would you do differently? One simulation is worth ten hours of solo practice.</p>
